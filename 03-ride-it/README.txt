This is a first implementation uploaded for the 3rd task in pont-excersises. This is my first version.

You can import this in eclipse, but make sure you also import the database (like into mysql workbench)

The project was written in eclipse ide, so the recommended program for build and run is eclipse (oxygen enterprise edition)

The project is still under developement.

Usage:

  -register users into database,
  -log in / sign in.
  -you will be redirected to the index.html page, on which all the registered cars (the cars driver) and the corresponding passenger 
    will be listed for you.
  -currently you can register to a car as passenger, and remove yourself from it7
  
Important:
  If you sign in as driver Do Not Try to remove/add yourself to a car, so I recommend to log in always as passenger. This feature is not implemented yet but is being under development.

Have fun..
